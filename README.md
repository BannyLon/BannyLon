👀 I’m interested in AIGC (Artificial Intelligence Generated Content), AI, technology trends, and programming languages such as Python and JavaScript. I'm fascinated by the intersection of these fields and their potential impact.
🌱 I’m currently learning all aspects of AIGC, mastering its tools and optimizing models, while also expanding my skills in AI, programming, and staying up-to-date with the latest technology trends.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects in the fields of education, tourism, youth sports, and anywhere AI and technology can make a positive impact. I'm particularly excited about leveraging AIGC and programming to create innovative solutions.
